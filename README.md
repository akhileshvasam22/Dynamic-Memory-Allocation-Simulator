# 🧠 Dynamic Memory Allocation Simulator in Java

This is a Java-based simulation of dynamic memory allocation using three widely known strategies: First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit. The program supports runtime operations like allocation, deallocation, memory compaction, and fragmentation tracking.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Implements **First Fit**, **Best Fit**, and **Worst Fit** memory allocation strategies  
- Supports **process deallocation** and **memory compaction**  
- Tracks and displays **external fragmentation** and **free partitions**  
- **Interactive command-line interface** for live simulation

## 📌 How It Works

### User Inputs:
- Total memory size  
- Number of processes and their sizes  
- Desired allocation strategy  

### Then:
- The program allocates memory using the selected strategy  
- Supports actions during runtime:  
  - Deallocate a process  
  - Compact memory to reduce fragmentation  
  - Allocate new processes dynamically
